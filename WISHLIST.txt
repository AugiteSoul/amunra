- pyramid room boss, drops the shuttle schematics
- nanite multitool
- MEGACRATER (generated structure)
- minimoon (generated structure in asteroid belt-like dimensions)
- mobs
- city ruins biome
- babel fish! crafted with freq module to a translation module
- connected block textures
- auto-refilling oxygen tanks
- oxygen mask which works under water
- dyed oxygen masks (so that vos6434 calms down^^)
- GC equipment items which use energy to do special things
- GC equipment "armor stand", which equips/unequips everything onto you on rightclick, and also recharges things
- methane sealer, to make the methane-breathing creatures able to survive other bodies -> by extension methane bubble maker
- tractor beam, use lots (million(s) RF/s!) to move a mothership, without any intervention of anything in target MS
- spaceships (abandoned or not) having neutral sentient crew, which can trade, and abandoned ships can be salvaged (?)
- Make sentries drop rayguns (perhaps even batteries?)
- ComputerCraft compat (functions to move MS, get current orbited body, get multi-sensor data)
- gravity superior to 12.5 m/sÂ² hurts user if he don't have enough armor, or if gravity is regulated, no need (support for MP gravity boots?)
- Make MS ultraviolet panels don't work during MS transit, while GS solar wind panels outputs a fixed value RF/t (50 RF/t?)
- Remote MS control? for harvest missions, like gas harvesting, or asteroid mining
- gravitationnal attraction, like you go faster to a star/black hole than a moon, by example, it's determined by body's gravity value, would be very slight
